Project Overview
This project is a modern, full-stack learning platform designed to provide a seamless and interactive educational experience. The frontend is a responsive single-page application built with React, offering a clean interface for content discovery. The backend is a robust Node.js and Express RESTful API that manages all data, user sessions, and integrations with external services. A PostgreSQL database, managed with the Drizzle ORM, ensures data integrity and scalability.

The application architecture is designed to be modular and scalable, with a clear separation between the frontend client and the backend server.

Core Features
Content Discovery: Search and filter a wide range of learning resources.

User Authentication: Secure user registration and login functionality.

Save Content: Logged-in users can save interesting content to their personal library.

Progress Tracking: Users can track their learning progress on individual content pieces.

External API Integration: Enriches the platform with content from external educational sources.

Technology Stack
This project leverages a modern PERN stack, chosen for its performance, scalability, and robust ecosystem.

Frontend: React (with Vite for a fast development experience)

Backend: Node.js with Express.js

Database: PostgreSQL

ORM: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database queries.

Language: TypeScript for both frontend and backend to ensure code quality and maintainability.

Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally on your machine.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or later recommended)

npm or yarn

PostgreSQL database server

Installation and Setup
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/Muel17/Test-Elice.git
cd Test-Elice
Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file in the packages/backend directory by copying the example file:

Bash

cp packages/backend/.env.example packages/backend/.env
Now, edit packages/backend/.env and add your PostgreSQL database connection string:

DATABASE_URL="postgresql://YOUR_USER:YOUR_PASSWORD@YOUR_HOST:5432/YOUR_DB_NAME"
Install dependencies:
This is a monorepo. Install all dependencies from the root directory.

Bash

npm install
Run database migrations:
Apply the database schema to your PostgreSQL database using Drizzle Kit.

Bash

npm run db:push --workspace=@my-app/backend
Run the application:
Start both the frontend and backend servers concurrently from the root directory.

Bash

npm run dev
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173 and the backend server will run on the port specified in your configuration.

API Documentation
The backend provides a RESTful API for managing users, content, and progress. The endpoints follow a logical, resource-oriented structure.

GET /api/v1/content: Search and retrieve learning content.

POST /api/v1/users/register: Register a new user.

POST /api/v1/users/login: Log in an existing user.

POST /api/v1/saved-content: Save content for a logged-in user.

DELETE /api/v1/saved-content/:id: Unsave content for a user.

PUT /api/v1/progress/:id: Update a user's progress on a piece of content.

Deployment
The application is deployed with a two-part strategy:

Backend API: The Node.js server and PostgreSQL database are hosted on Render.

Frontend App: The React application is deployed on Netlify.
